            This checks the current status of this repository against the latest version of all the Submariner projects it depends on.
            If something fails, the failure should be investigated and at least tracked as an issue blocking the next release.
            Since some CI only runs periodically, if on-PR CI passes it's still good to merge this update for full integration coverage.

            Update submariner-io/* dependencies to latest

            This upgrades all our dependencies on other Submariner projects to their
            latest development snapshots, ensuring the code in the projects remains
            coherent and that tests of development images verify the latest code.
